            <p>
                I created this project as a part of the Fullstack-engineer carrerpath at codeacademy
                but I also think it is a good think to show in my portfolio.
                It is fully responsive, it works in many different screensizes.
                You can add both post and subreddits to your favorites, but this app doesn't have a backend
                so after leaving the page everything will be lost, this is only a homework project not a 
                final product.
                I had a lot of fun programming this!!
            </p>
        </div>
